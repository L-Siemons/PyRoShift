# README #

The main algorithm is in Master_2.py (currently)
an example how to run it is found in /exmapleRun/

### What is this repository for? ###

* This repository is aiming to make a general algorithm so 
  determine rotamer states for *some* residues  
* [Learn Markdown](https://bitbucket.org/tutorials/markdowndemo)

### How do I get set up? ###

In the simplest case for ILE just edit Measured_shifts.txt
and run ./Master_2.py. Note make sure that the DFT results are in
the Results.dat file!

### Contribution guidelines ###

we probably need to think about these ...
* Writing tests
* Code review
* Other guidelines

### Who do I talk to? ###

* If you have any questions please come and find lucas ... who will probably direct you to flemming :P
